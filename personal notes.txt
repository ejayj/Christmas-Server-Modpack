These are just some personal notes for myself on potential modpacks baj, myself and others have considered c:

More notes:

cant open presents in christmas festivity mod, the interactive ones are single player only
the others are just decor
custom error message so when people join, and cant get in they they get a link to the modpack

notes: 
configure discord, permissions from before, and maybe even creative zonel change jade bot to christmas
server ip: lospolloshermanos.ddns.net

waiting for modpack to get approved, may have to send email.

Made a secondary modpack.
Simple modpack contains the mods in this modpack, the secondary contains additions: crayfish furniture (which may cause some people lag), the create mod and an addition to the create mod.
